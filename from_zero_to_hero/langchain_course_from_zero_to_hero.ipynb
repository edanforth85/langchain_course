The mission has concluded that the solar-powered lander has run out of energy after more than four years on the Red Planet and Perseverance rover has drilled and collected four slim cores of sedimentary rock, formed in what was once a lake on Mars.\u001b[0m\n",

            "Final Answer: NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover is the largest and most capable rover ever sent to Mars. It is looking for signs of past microbial life, caching rock and soil samples, and preparing for future human exploration. The mission has found evidence of ancient riverbeds, and the rover has taken pictures of the Martian landscape.
